# Convolutional Neural Networks for Efficient Garbage Classification

This repo presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed to classify images of garbage
into six categories. The goal was to improve the efficiency of
waste management and recycling processes by automating the
classification of garbage. We introduce a sequential CNN model
trained on a dataset comprising images of cardboard, glass,
metal, paper, plastic, and trash, showing promising results in
automated waste sorting.
